## Code Structure

```
üìÅ Project Root
|-- üìÑ ContentView.swift     // Main view of the app
|-- üìÑ PlatformItems.swift  // Model for platform items
|-- üìÑ Create1View.swift    // View for creating new items
|-- üìÑ UpdateView.swift     // View for updating existing items
|-- üìÑ SettingsView.swift   // View for toggling dark mode settings
```

**Key Elements**:
- **Environment and State Variables**: Manages dark mode, edit, and delete confirmation states.
- **Custom Views**: Modular design with separate views for creating and updating items.
- **Query and Context**: Uses `@Query` and `@Environment(\_.modelContext)` to interact with the app's data model.

---

## Customization

1. **Change Color Scheme**:
   - Modify `isDarkMode` to set the preferred color scheme.

2. **Change the Item Model**:
   - Update the `PlatformItems` model to add more properties (e.g., category, priority, etc.).

3. **Update List Design**:
   - Customize the `LazyVGrid` and `ForEach` loops to change how items are displayed.

## Accessibility

The app follows best practices for accessibility:
- **VoiceOver Labels**: Items have labels for titles, descriptions, and remaining days.
- **Dynamic Text**: Uses `Text` elements that support dynamic font sizes.
- **High-Contrast Support**: Supports both light and dark themes.
